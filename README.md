# Experiments on Fairness in Machine Learning models

This repository contains the code for the experiments on fairness in machine learning models.
The experiments comprehend methods from the literature that are based on in-processing regularization.
We make use of autoML to fine-tune the models and fairly evaluate them on benchmark datasets.
